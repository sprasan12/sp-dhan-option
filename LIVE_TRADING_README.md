## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

   ```bash
   cp live_trading_config_example.txt .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Replace these with your actual Dhan credentials
   DHAN_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
   DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_access_token
   TRADING_SYMBOL=NIFTY 21 AUG 24700 CALL
   
   # Set trading mode to live
   TRADING_MODE=live
   
   # Adjust account balance to match your actual balance
   ACCT_START_BALANCE=50000
   ```

### 2. Credential Requirements

**Dhan API Credentials:**
- **Client ID**: Your Dhan trading account client ID
- **Access Token**: Your Dhan API access token
- **Trading Symbol**: The exact option symbol you want to trade

**How to get credentials:**
1. Log into your Dhan trading account
2. Go to API settings/developers section
3. Generate API credentials
4. Note down Client ID and Access Token

### 3. Risk Management Settings

**Critical Parameters to Review:**

```bash
# Fixed Stop Loss Amount (10% of account balance)
FIXED_SL_PERCENTAGE=10.0

# Maximum SL as percentage of market price (15%)
MAX_SL_PERCENTAGE_OF_PRICE=15.0

# Trading quantity (start with 1 lot)
TRADING_QUANTITY=1

# Lot size (75 for NIFTY options)
LOT_SIZE=75
```

**Risk Calculation Example:**
- Account Balance: ‚Çπ50,000
- Fixed SL Amount: ‚Çπ5,000 (10% of balance)
- If market price is ‚Çπ100 and SL is ‚Çπ90:
  - Risk per lot = 75 √ó (100-90) = ‚Çπ750
  - Max lots = ‚Çπ5,000 √∑ ‚Çπ750 = 6 lots
- If SL is ‚Çπ85 (15% of ‚Çπ100), max lots = ‚Çπ5,000 √∑ ‚Çπ1,125 = 4 lots
